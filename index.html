    <p>Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC) is a replacement for spoken language for individuals with limited or no verbal communication. AAC supports individuals in expressing their needs, thoughts, and emotions. There are different types of AAC: AAC devices with AI, like prediction, personalization, and word selection. Also, non-AI AAC devices rely on traditional programming and algorithms. Some AAC systems use low-tech tools, such as a notebook with stickers or symbols for users to point to. As a result, most prefer AAC with AI because it shows interactive features, like many pictures and voice. However, AAC with AI sometimes causes outages, hangs, confusion, and errors related to personalization and word selection, so it disappoints.</p>
