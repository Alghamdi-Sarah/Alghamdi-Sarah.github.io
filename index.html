<p>Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC) is a replacement for spoken language for individuals with limited or no verbal communication. AAC supports individuals in expressing their needs, thoughts, and emotions. There are different types of AAC: AAC devices with AI, like prediction, personalization, and word selection. Also, non-AI AAC devices rely on traditional programming and algorithms. Some AAC systems use low-tech tools, such as a notebook with stickers or symbols for users to point to. As a result, most prefer AAC with AI because it shows interactive features, like many pictures and voice. However, AAC with AI sometimes causes outages, hangs, confusion, and errors related to personalization and word selection, so it disappoints.</p><br>

<p> There is a new videoconferencing platform designed to improve communication among deaf, hard-of-hearing, and hearing individuals. Researchers found that, after testing with 34 participants, users adjusted the layout based on their needs and adapted to the groupâ€™s communication style. Notifications were helpful but sometimes caused too many interruptions.
There are also problems with other video platforms like Zoom. Significant barriers for deaf, hard-of-hearing, and hearing users include poor audio quality, captioning errors, difficulty recognizing who is speaking, and the loss of benefits from a customized home setup.</p><br>
